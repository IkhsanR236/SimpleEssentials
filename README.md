# SimpleEssentials
The re-creation of essentials with my own version is still in the pre-release stage,

I'm still developing this plugin so just wait for the next feature update update

# YourCode? 
(for now 16/10/2020 I only made heal, chatlock, and clearchat commands so just wait for the next update)
